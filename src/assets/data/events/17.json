I heard he found the City of Gods but didn't survive long enough to come back and tell the tale. He must've still gotten his notebook out to you guys before he was gone forever. \n *you ask about the City of Gods* \n Mateo: Of course the City of Gods is real! How could you not know? \n *you ask about monsters* \n The Hydra is the most powerful. You have to use a specific wizard spell for the most success. A Chill Touch will almost kill it instantly. \n *You can approach another villager but the entire village appears wary and scared of your arrival.*"
