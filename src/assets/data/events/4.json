Villager 1: gray hair, eye patch, tall-as big as barbarian-a sneer on his face. Villager 2: Thin woman with a baby, looks to be in her twenties. Brown hair in low bun with strands hanging out. Dirty dress that looked like it once had color. Looks scared. Villager 3: Woman with dark skin and smooth dark hair. Pirate-y garb. Beautiful, buff. Looks to be in charge.
