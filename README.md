This project is a text based java game following the Dungeons and Dragons campaign "Isle of Dread". It features a GUI with sprites, action buttons, a console to output story text, and a main image window to display enemies, NPCs, and the player's location on the map. This program utilizes the libGDX game framework and JSON to load game data. Development was started in January of 2024 for Wright State University's Software Development course, CEG 4110, and has four contributors: Bella, Joe, Heidi, and Ren.
